# CRISP-DM Pipeline with the Iris Dataset ðŸŒ¸

This repository contains my solution to a task assigned by my mentor as part of my ongoing machine learning learning journey. The goal was to **explain and demonstrate** the steps involved in building a machine learning pipeline using the **CRISP-DM framework**, applied to the classic **Iris dataset** using **scikit-learn**.

---

## Task Description

Explain the steps you would take to build a machine learning pipeline using the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, and demonstrate it using the **Iris dataset** with **scikit-learn**.
